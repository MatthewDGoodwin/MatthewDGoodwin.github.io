    This week’s project was to become familiarized with the epilogue laser printer. For this project I also decided to tackle the fusion 360 design software. This software is very helpful for laser cutting work because its sketch feature allows for the creation of detailed, dimensionally accurate, 2d sketches. The most difficult part of adapting fusion 360 is exporting the sketch as a DXF file which saves all lines as a vector so that adobe illustrator can read it. To start with I drew up 5 “swatches” in fusion and exported them to adobe illustrator where I added the vector and raster test and cut them out. The purpose of the swatches was to test the power and speed of the vector and raster setting on the printer. Because the vector has 3 different setting and the raster setting has two values, I only changed the power values across all the swatches. For the vector values the speed remained at 70 and frequency remained at 80.  The swatches were cut out of cardboard, birch plywood, MDF and polyacrylic resin. A PDF of the swatch designs can be found<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1974L-4-PGH1azq-iLQpPF-6Lxi7sr3RG/view?usp=sharing"> here. </a>

      Next I had to tackle the box with a “living hinge” I love boxes and decided I wanted to try to make one that was both unique and featured a mostly if not completely glue less design. I also wanted to make the most use of the flexible living hinge that I possibly could. Finally, i decided to create my box out of an octagon with the angles between the 8 sides being made from the living hinge. I also decided that the box should be held closed with a band like a wooden barrel. The initial idea was drawn up in my sketch book where I also did some math to determine the angles and the dimensions I wanted for the box. With me dimensions decided upon I wanted to do some tests to see how far I could push the living hinge so I cut a small piece on the laser cutter and was very pleased to discover I could bend the hinge a full 180°.

         A significant problem I had to overcome was how to design the band that would hold the box together. This was difficult because not only as the sides of the box separated by a 135° angle but the hinge would form a radius. To determine that radius I made a jig that simulated the angle of two opposing sides. I then cut and fitted a sample of living hinge and marked then measured 3 points on the curve. With those three points I was able to recreate that radius on the interior of the band using fusion 360. I then sketched up the side panel of the box and the band in fusion and placed them on the same adobe illustrator document in preparation to cut the box.

        I was unsure of how the box would turn out, specifically the “band” that was designed to hold it together. Unfortunately, this was where the project began to fall apart. Three things in particular lead me to abandon the octagonal box. The first was that despite having the calculations I could not get the inner radius of the band to fit the outer radius of sides of the box without significant gaps. The second issue I encountered was that the “band” did not fit aesthetically with shape of the box. I also decided that because there were to many corners. I think that box would have been much better functionally and aesthetically if I had chosen a simpler shape like a square. Unfortunately, because I was running out of time this is a project I will have to revisit in the future.

       Because I still had to submit a box, I decided to use a box from the online calculator which can be found <a href="https://www.festi.info/boxes.py/RoundedBox?FingerJoint_angle=90.0&FingerJoint_style=rectangular&FingerJoint_surroundingspaces=2.0&FingerJoint_edge_width=1.0&FingerJoint_finger=2.0&FingerJoint_play=0.0&FingerJoint_space=2.0&FingerJoint_width=1.0&x=150.0&y=150.0&h=150.0&outside=0&outside=1&radius=15&wallpieces=1&edge_style=f&top=closed&thickness=3.0&format=svg&tabs=0.0&debug=0&reference=100&burn=0.1&render=1">here </a>.  I decided to go with “rounded corner” box design. I designed the dimensions to be 150mm by 150mm by 150mm. I also opted for a lid which allowed me to place my name and the date in an accessible yet subtle location. This was cut on the laser cutter with the vector values of 100p,5s,100freq and raster settings of 75p, 20s.

        Overall, this project was a bit harder than I had anticipated and I was quite disappointed that I could not make the octagonal box work. However, I think it’s not the end of the word and I still have significant doubts whether it would have look proportional or not. I was very pleased with the box I ended up with and it will become a standard in my dorm room set up.
